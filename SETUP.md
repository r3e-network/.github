# Organization README Setup Guide

This document explains how to set up the organization README for r3e-network to display on the GitHub organization home page.

## üìã Requirements

To display an organization README on GitHub, you need to create a special repository called `.github` within your organization.

## üöÄ Setup Steps

### 1. Create the `.github` Repository

1. Go to your r3e-network organization on GitHub
2. Click "New repository"
3. Name the repository exactly: `.github`
4. Make it public (required for organization READMEs)
5. Initialize with a README (optional, we'll replace it)

### 2. Repository Structure

The repository should have this structure:
```
.github/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ profile/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md    # This is the organization README
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md        # Optional: repository-specific README
```

### 3. Upload the README

1. Create a `profile` directory in the `.github` repository
2. Upload the `profile/README.md` file created in this workspace
3. Commit and push the changes
