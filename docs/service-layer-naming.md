# Neo Service Layer - Service Naming Convention
## Comprehensive Naming Guide for R3E Labs Service Architecture

### 📋 Naming Philosophy

Following the **NeoMind** pattern for the confidential AI service, all Neo Service Layer components use consistent naming that combines:
- **"Neo" prefix** - Establishes ecosystem identity
- **Descriptive core name** - Clearly indicates service function  
- **Service categorization** - Groups related capabilities

## 🎯 Naming Convention Rules

### **Primary Guidelines**
1. **Neo Prefix**: All services start with "Neo" for ecosystem consistency
2. **Single Word Core**: Use one descriptive word for the main function
3. **Clear Purpose**: Name should immediately convey service functionality
4. **No Redundancy**: Avoid "Service" suffix since context is clear
5. **Memorable**: Easy to remember and pronounce

### **Examples of Good Names**
- ✅ **NeoMind** - AI computation (clear, memorable)
- ✅ **NeoVault** - Key management (secure connotation)
- ✅ **NeoWatch** - Monitoring (action-oriented)
- ✅ **NeoFair** - Fair ordering (value-oriented)

### **Examples to Avoid**
- ❌ **NeoRandomnessService** - Too long, redundant suffix
- ❌ **NeoOracleDataService** - Multiple descriptors
- ❌ **NeoMLAI** - Unclear abbreviations
- ❌ **NeoSvc** - Generic, uninformative
