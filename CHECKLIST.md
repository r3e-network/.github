## ðŸš€ Quick Commands

Copy the updated `profile/README.md` file to your `.github` repository:
```bash
# After cloning the .github repository
mkdir -p profile
cp /path/to/this/workspace/profile/README.md profile/
git add profile/README.md
git commit -m "Update organization README with Neo full nodes and enhanced project highlighting"
git push origin main
```

Deploy updated website:
```bash
# Copy website files to hosting platform
cp -r website/* /path/to/deployment/
# Or commit to GitHub Pages/Netlify repository
```
